How to Play:
Object: Score the most points before you run out of tries. 
When the game begins, players have 3 tries.

Board Setup:
[deck] [base(revealed)] [row1] [row2] [row3] [row4] [bonus] 

Player predicts whether next card (L to R) will be "higher" or "lower"
or if a swap is available, player can choose to swap the card.

If the most recent revealed card is a joker, the player collects a bonus and swaps out the card for free.

After a Prediction is made and next card is revealed:
- If new card is a joker, collect bonus and swap for free
- If prediction is correct, player earns points, the revealed card is now the 'base card' and play continues. 
- If prediction is incorrect, the mini-game is over and the player loses a try. If there are no more tries, 
the game is over. Otherwise, the player loses a try and the board resets for a new mini-game.

PLAYERS WANT TO WIN A ROW by making four correct predictions. In the final stage of a mini-game, players will 
make a bonus prediction (no swap available, no penalty if incorrect). If the bonus prediction is correct, the player 
will collect a bonus of their choice!

NOT ALL STAGES HAVE SWAPS!
NOT ALL SWAPS ARE FOR FREE!
